# 0002 — A migrated tenant keeps the owner's legacy `users.id`

## Context

The legacy system has no `tenants` table. The tenant _was_ the owner's row in
`users`: a row with `company_id IS NULL` and `isOwner IS NOT NULL`. Every other row
in the database points back at that row through `company_id = owner.id`, and the
code resolves the tenant on almost every query with the idiom
`company_id ?? user.id`.

The rebuild makes that structure explicit: a real `Tenant` model, a non-null
`tenantId` on every domain table, and a `tenantId` claim that the auth middleware
resolves once from the token. The remaining question is what value the `id` of a
migrated tenant should have, because thousands of rows already reference the
legacy value.

## Decision

**When a legacy database is migrated, `Tenant.id` is set to the owner's existing
`users.id`, verbatim.**

Companion rule, same rationale and same migration pass: **primary keys of other
migrated rows are preserved as well** — in particular `User.id` (the owner's and
every staff member's) — because `sales.sold_by_one…four`,
`employee_comissions.user_id`, `employee_leaves.user_id` and the department joins
all reference them.

Consequences that follow from the decision and are part of it:

1. A legacy id is numeric and is copied as a **string** (`"412"`, not `412`), so
   `Tenant.id` stays a plain `String @id`.
2. Tenants created _after_ the cutover get a generated id (`cuid()`, the default
   used by every model in `schema.prisma`). `cuid()` values are alphanumeric and
   never numeric, so a new tenant can never collide with a not-yet-migrated legacy
   id.
3. The migration is idempotent and restartable: re-running it over the same source
   produces the same target ids, so a failed run does not leave half a database
   pointing at ids that no longer exist.

## Why not the alternatives

| Alternative                                                                          | Why it was rejected                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generate a new UUID for every tenant and keep a `legacy_id → tenant_id` lookup table | Every `company_id` in the source has to be rewritten in a second pass. A run that dies half-way leaves rows pointing at ids that exist in no table, and the failure is silent: the FK either was not enforced (legacy `company_id` had no constraint at all) or the row migrates with the wrong tenant. Nothing in the new schema can detect it afterwards. |
| Keep the mapping table permanently and translate on read                             | A join on every query, forever, in exchange for an opaque id nobody asked for. It also hides the failure mode above instead of removing it: a missing mapping row becomes an empty result set rather than an error.                                                                                                                                         |
| Derive the id from something natural (`slug`, owner email, `company_name`)           | All three are mutable — a salon renames itself and its primary key changes. It also forces uniqueness decisions (two salons named "Beauty Corner") that the legacy data cannot answer.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Give migrated tenants fresh ids but keep the legacy ids only in an audit column      | Solves nothing the mapping-table option did not already solve; the references still have to be rewritten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Consequences

**Positive**

- The domain migrates with **zero remapping**: every legacy `company_id` is
  already a valid `tenantId`, so the copy is a straight `INSERT … SELECT`. This is
  the property that makes the whole cutover a one-pass job.
- Tenant-scoping bugs are loud. `company_id` was nullable and unconstrained, so a
  wrong value silently returned nothing or another salon's rows; after the
  migration the same value is a real foreign key, and a wrong one fails the insert.
- Support and operations stay cheap: "which salon is id 412?" is answered by the
  same number in the legacy system, the new database, the logs and whatever the
  operator has on paper.
- The shipped mobile client (whose API surface is frozen, see
  [`../legacy/API-INVENTORY.md`](../legacy/API-INVENTORY.md)) keeps returning the
  ids it already returns. No client release is coupled to the cutover.

**Negative / accepted costs**

- `Tenant.id` is not opaque; it reveals how old a tenant is and where it sits in the
  legacy numbering. Accepted: tenant ids are already visible in URLs to their own
  users, and nothing in the threat model depends on an unguessable tenant id —
  authorisation is decided by the token's `tenantId`, not by the id's shape.
- The rule "a migrated tenant keeps a numeric id, a new tenant gets a `cuid()`"
  must be written down. It is, here.
- If a _second_ legacy instance is ever migrated into the same database, its owner
  ids have to be checked against existing `tenants.id` values before importing.
  Documented as a migration precondition rather than solved in advance.

**Neutral**

- `platform_admins` ids are not preserved by this decision; nothing outside the
  legacy database references them, so the console may generate its own.
- `Tenant.ownerUserId` points at the owner's `User.id`, which — because of the
  companion rule — happens to equal `Tenant.id`. That is a coincidence of the
  migration, not a constraint: nothing in the schema or in application code may
  assume `tenant.id === owner.id`.

## Enforcement

- `tenants.id` carries a primary-key (therefore unique) constraint; the migration
  asserts uniqueness of its source rows before copying.
- The two rules in "Decision" are checked by a migration test that runs the
  importer twice over a fixture and asserts identical target ids.
