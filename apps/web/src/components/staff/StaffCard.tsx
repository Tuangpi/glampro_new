/**
 * The person cell on every staff row — handoff screen 09.
 *
 * Initials, the name, and the login the person signs in with. The email is the
 * second line rather than a column of its own because it is the one field on this
 * screen that is **not** edited here: `updateStaffSchema` has no `email`, since a
 * login email is an authentication fact rather than a profile one. Showing it under
 * the name keeps it visible while the drawer never offers a box for it.
 *
 * Decorative chip: the name is always rendered beside it, so a screen reader gains
 * nothing from hearing the initials.
