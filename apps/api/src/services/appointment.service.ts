/**
 * Appointments — handoff screens 03 and 06, `/api/appointments`.
 *
 * Like every service here, each function runs inside the tenant scope
 * `middleware/auth.ts` opened, so none of them takes a tenant id and a handler
 * naming another salon's booking simply finds nothing (AGENTS.md rule 1).
 * Rows are serialised **through** the shared Zod schemas, so a column added to
 * `Appointment` and forgotten here throws instead of reaching the browser
 * outside its contract (AGENTS.md rule 6).
 *
 * Two rules this service owns rather than delegating to the browser:
 *
 * 1. **Duration comes from the service.** `endsAt` and `durationMinutes` are
 *    computed here from `Service.durationMinutes`, never taken from the
 *    request (`docs/mvp.md` → M2). A booking's length is a fact about the
 *    service, and a form that could post its own end time would put a
 *    two-hour block on a one-hour service.
 * 2. **A performer must belong to the service's department.** The form offers
 *    only staff whose `User.departments` contain the service's branch, and the
 *    API refuses the ones it would not have offered rather than trusting the
 *    list it sent (ADR 0013 — the booking twin of M1's till decision).
