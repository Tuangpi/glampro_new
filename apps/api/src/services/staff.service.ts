/**
 * Staff — handoff screen 09, `GET /api/staff`.
 *
 * **A staff member is a `User` row, not a table of its own.** Legacy settled this
 * (Q4 in `legacy/LEGACY-MAP.md` §6): `EmployeeController::create()` created a
 * `User`, and `employee_leaves.employee_id` was a foreign key onto `users.id`. So
 * this module reads and writes `User` plus its `StaffDepartment` links — and
 * **creating staff creates a login**, which makes this the one place in the API
 * where a password is set on somebody else's behalf.
 *
 * Nothing here can leak credential material: every row is serialised through
 * `staffSummarySchema`, which has no `passwordHash` and no token column, and the
 * select below fetches none. `User` is a wide table — it also carries Google
 * Calendar tokens — so a `select: *` would be a real leak, and AGENTS.md rule 6 is
 * what makes the two lists have to agree.
 *
 * Every function runs inside the tenant scope `middleware/auth.ts` opened, so no
 * function takes a tenant id and another salon's user is simply not found.
