/**
 * Sales — handoff screens 01–02, `/api/sales`.
 *
 * This file starts with the item search the cashier types into before anything is in
 * the cart (Phase 5b.1). The write — the cart, the holdings and points it creates, and
 * the receipt number — is 5b.2 and lands here too.
 *
 * The search is **entitlement aware**, and that is the interesting part. A route
 * guarded by an add-on refuses with `403 MODULE_NOT_ENTITLED`, which is right when the
 * whole route *is* the add-on. Here the add-on is one kind among five inside a core
 * feature, so a salon without it gets a shorter list rather than a refused request —
 * and the answer names the kinds it covers (`searchableKinds`) so the picker can draw
 * the tabs it can fill instead of an empty one. "You have none" and "you do not have
 * this" stay different statements, which is the rule the catalogue tabs already keep.
 *
 * Like every other service here, each function runs inside the tenant scope
 * `middleware/auth.ts` opened, so none of them takes a tenant id. Rows are serialised
 * **through** the shared Zod schemas, so a column added to a model and forgotten here
 * throws instead of reaching the browser outside its contract (AGENTS.md rule 6).
