/**
 * Appointment contracts — handoff screens 03 and 06, `GET /api/appointments`.
 *
 * The booking model is `Appointment` exactly as Phase 2 left it: a time window
 * (`startsAt`/`endsAt`), a status, and optional links to a customer, a member of
 * staff and a service. Three columns are copied rather than derived —
 * `durationMinutes` is snapshotted from the service at booking time so a later
 * catalogue edit does not silently move an existing appointment (the schema's
 * own comment says so), while the names ride along denormalised so a receipt or
 * a day list renders without three joins.
 *
 * **The client never sends a duration or an end time.** The MVP's rule
 * (`docs/mvp.md` → M2) is that duration comes from the service rather than from
 * free text, so `createAppointmentSchema` takes a start and a `serviceId` and
 * the server computes the rest. A browser that could post its own `endsAt`
 * would put a two-hour booking on a one-hour service and the clash detection
 * that full-phase booking adds later would be judging a fiction.
